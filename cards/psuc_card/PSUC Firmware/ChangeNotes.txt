1. Fixed the RS232 serial IO. 

2. Added a command function 'd', to convert the ps_data_blk to 
   an ascii hex string, and output it on RS232.

3. Changed the temperature sense and save order, so the the PSUC
   temerature is always TEMP1.  TEMP2 and TEMP3 are PSU and PSU
   heatsink temperatures.

4. Added a command function 't', to convert the ps_data_blk
   temperatures to an ascii hex string, and output them on RS232.


5. added commands 'v' and 'i' to output the re-scaled ADC values of
   the PSU voltages and currents from the data_block.

6. added commands 'f' and 'n' to turn_off or turn_on the PSU outputs.
