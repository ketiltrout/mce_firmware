Change Notes for PSUC Firmware Version 3.1 15March2007 RHJ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Fixed the RS232 serial IO. 

2. Added a command function 'd', to convert the ps_data_blk to 
   an ascii hex string, and output it on RS232.

3. Changed the temperature sense and save order, so the the PSUC
   temerature is always TEMP1.  TEMP2 and TEMP3 are PSU and PSU
   heatsink temperatures.

4. Added a command function 't', to convert the ps_data_blk
   temperatures to an ascii hex string, and output them on RS232.


5. added commands 'v' and 'i' to output the re-scaled ADC values of
   the PSU voltages and currents from the data_block.
	From data_blk: 03.16 04.84 10.07 06.48 -06.52
	     Measured:  3.15  4.85 10.11  6.48  -6.51

6. added commands 'f' and 'n' to turn_off or turn_on the PSU outputs.

7. changed version command to '?'.

8. Several changes and tests were done to try and get soft_reset
   to work consistently. 
	- LED_STATUS on P1-pin3 was used as a test o/p to check for switch
	bounce and the timing and functioning of soft_reset, while also 
	watching the reset-switch input on P4;
	- interrupt priorities and register sets were varied.

Change Notes for PSUC Firmware v3.2 22March2007 RHJ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. fixed the value for CF_nIVa which was missing a 0.

2. for Cycle_Power, changed the off time to 2 seconds from 100 mS.

3. changed the Reset command BRST time to 2 second from 100 mS.

4. disabled reset-button and watch_dog soft_resets; 
	disabled Timer2 interrupts.

5. commented out the ADC_OFFSET conversion.

6. changed the version command, '?' to a version + help command.
	Note: at first this was implemented as two separate routines,
	snd_msg(asc_version), and snd_msg(helpmsg); this worked when 
	called one after the other at startup, but would hang when 
	called as a command response.  No obvious fault was found to
	explain the program hanging problem, and a possible stack
	overflow was suspected.  Adding the version text to the beginning
	of the help string and removing any separate call to
 	snd_msg(asc_version) seems to have fixed the problem.

7. changed wait_time(unsigned char loops) 
	to wait_time(unsigned int loops).

8. changed Cycle_Power off time to 4 seconds from 2 seconds.

9. changed the Reset command BRST time to 4 second from 2 seconds.

10. changed ACK_NAK bit in data_blk to DATABLK_UPDATED; 
	this bit is set after the data_blk is updated, and cleared after
    the data_blk has been sent to the CC. 
	[done in the program main loop]
