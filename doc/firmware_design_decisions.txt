- The address of any functional block, whether 8-, 16- or 32-bits will always be encoded to the lowest bits on the address bus to the slave_ctrl block.

- BoardID and BoxID will always be read during a subrack reset or power-up so that the information is available as soon as the user wants it (otherwise need to wait several milli-sec) and more importantly so that the temperature of the board is immediately available without needing to query the silicon-id chip for it's serial number first.

- March 11, 2003:
  Since our Stratix EP1S10/30's don't have the capability to drive high impedence on internal buses, for our wishbone
  implementation, will multiplex the outgoing data lines.  The multiplexor select lines will be derived from our wishbone
  address map.  The rty and ack signals will not be multiplexed, they will be OR'ed out towards the master.  Therefore,
  the rty and ack signals should only be active when the slave is selected.  For the outgoing data, they will all be
  connected to the 32-bit wishbone bus, however, for slaves that don't use all 32-bits (such as the array_id for example),
  the unused bits should be tied to zero '0' so that the Quartus synthesis tool can optimize those signals away.  Another
  note, the data multiplexor should not be one-hot encoded, as unused data signals here cannot easily be optimized away by
  Quartus.
